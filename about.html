        Our application is a model for ransomware, but it does not cause any permanent damage, while on normal applications, it would have to be remotely unlocked.
        One thing to note though is that this may not work for MacOS machines and only really works for windows.

      <div class="sep"><h2>How application works:</h2>
      Our application starts with a fake captcha in order to trick the user into accepting the download. Following that, it will start encrypting files on the persons computer with three different encryption methods out of a pool of five encryptions. After the person “pays” for their files, the Decrypter inside the app will run all five decryption methods on the files, and the program automatically deletes itself, making a ransomware that is extremely hard to track.
      However, our version of the ransomware creates its own folder and encrypts the files in that folder. This therefore does not harm any individual's personal computer

      <div class="sep"><h3>Additional Information:</h3>
        Our product will only work with our devices as the product is configured to our system's file interface. Also, this virus will mainly work in windows machines but not mac or linux. Finally, if you want to see the virus run its course on your machine, make sure that you have this directory in your machine: "C:\\Users\\tjmon\\3D Objects\\C Drive".
