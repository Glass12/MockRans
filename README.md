# MockRans
For the Hackathon

by Hakcthon Haxers

This is a website/virus demonstrating how ransomware works and describing the different types of other cyber threats out there. The Ransomware download is a "model" and is not intended to actually harm any system. It simply is an abridged version of how a ransomware attack might work. The code was tailored to work in a set of folders in my computer that mimiced a mini computer. With some slight editing to the paths, this could probably work on a whole system, however, I dare not try this. The virus does not bypass antivirus either, as this would take me more than a day to figure out. So, if any crazy ppls want to download this, make sure antivirus is off.

Although the button on our download page say "Download" we include the fake human or Captcha test to show an example of how some malicious parties might go about installing real malware onto your system. Looking at recent events, a common trend among malicious parties to download ransomware was a fake Captcha test. The malicious webpage would prompt users to do their fake test, often involving the user to press the ENTER key. By doing this users would unknowingly approve the download of a malicious file by pressing the ENTER key on the fake test. We made our little spinoff of this to raise awareness for the different cunning ways that hackers might make use of in order to get one's computer infected.
