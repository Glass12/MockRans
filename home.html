        What is a Virus?
      </h1>

      <p class="content">
        By strict definition, a computer virus is a piece of code which is capable of copying itself and typically has a detrimental effect, such as corrupting the system or destroying data. By plain meaning, this means that a virus is anything that harms the computer.

        Common Viruses
      </h1>

      <p class="content">
        Some of the most common types of viruses are the multipartite virus, direct action (remote control), browser hijacker, overwrite virus (usually ransomware, but sometimes intended to destroy), file infector (almost certainly ransomware), and the internet virus.

      Virus Capabilities
    </h1>

    <p class="content">
      Viruses have two main purposes: to steal and destroy. These two categories are mainly split into several smaller categories, such as Key-logging(track keyboard input), ransomware(locks up document), remote-control, theft of information, and destruction(with many ways, includes both online attacks that require an offline part on the computer, or attack on the hardware by creating files). Within these types of viruses, viruses that are meant to steal are often much harder to create and destroy than viruses with the intention to destroy.

        Trojan Viruses
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        The trojan virus is, in general, the most common type of virus. As the name suggests, trojan viruses usually appear as one program, but does something else entirely. This could include applications that sell cheaper versions of official files that are harder to obtain, free video games, etc. The easiest way in general to avoid trojan viruses is by only giving apps authentication that is directly related to what the app does, unless with good reason. This will ensure that only the “good” part of applications will be used.

        Multipartite Virus
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        The Multipartite Virus is a virus that targets multiple parts of a computer at once, and is usually allowed access through unauthorized authentication. This virus is mainly spread with unauthorized/ accidentally authorized actions. This is generally agreed to be the deadliest virus, as it is self replicating, and nearly impossible to destroy. This virus’s main way of accessing the computer through the internet. The only way to stop this virus is by not authenticating anything that you do not need.

        Keyloggers, Token loggers, and Browser Hijackers
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        Key loggers, or sometimes, token loggers are amongst the most basic, yet most effective way to steal information. Key loggers are never presented alone, they are always part of a trojan virus.  Key loggers, and token loggers are meant to capture the input of the keyboard, and the output of authentication on certain platforms. Key loggers are very hard to defend against, but is still not impossible. The only way to effectively defend against a key logger is by using third party applications, wether to encrypt your keyboard, or to scan for the virus. The reason that key loggers do not require authentication is that on default, all applications are granted access to track the input of the mouse and the  Token loggers, on other hand is slightly easier to defend. These are much deadlier, but is easier to track.

        Ransomwares, Overwriting Viruses, and File Infectors
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        Ransomwares, overwrite viruses and file editors are usually used for similar purposes. They both edit files on other people’s computers, and the user usually has to do something in order to get back their files.  This would usually include paying money, or giving other values to the person who put the virus. While ransomware mainly focuses on locking files, file editors are usually for forcibly encrypting files. Both of these viruses can only be prevented by not giving them authentication to edit files, and are usually parts of trojan that eventually try to gain your trust.

      Internet Viruses
    </h1>

    <p class="content">
      Internet viruses are usually one of two types. The two types of viruses do the exact same job, but through different methods. The first method requires a trojan virus to deploy a packet-spammer onto any internet using application, so that whenever a packet is sent, it would be resent many more (100-10k) times, jamming the channel. However, this method will still allow files to travel into the computer through existing channels. The second method does not require of application on targets computer, but is instead based on the IPV6 of the targets computer. This method is commonly know as the DOS attack(denial of service), and is used similarly as the first method, but additionally blocks out incoming sources as well.

      General defense against viruses
    </h1>

    <img src="images/norton.jpg" class="norton">

    <p class="content">
      Viruses are most easily defended with 3rd party applications like Norton which can detect and disable viruses before they can harm your computer. Even easier than that, is to never give applications authentications that do not need, and in short, do not download random applications from the internet.
