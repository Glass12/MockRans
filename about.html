    <p class="content">
      Our application is a model for ransomware, but it does not cause any permanent damage, while on normal applications, it would have to be remotely unlocked. 


How application works:

Our application starts with a fake captcha, where it tricks the user into giving it permissions. Following that, it will start encrypting files on the persons computer with three different encryption methods out of a pool of five encryptions. After the person “pays” for their files, the Decrypter inside the app will run all five decryption methods on the files, and the program automatically deletes itself, making a ransomware that is extremely hard to track.
