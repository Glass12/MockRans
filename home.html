        What is a Virus?
      </h1>

      <p class="content">
        By strict definition, a computer virus is a piece of code which is capable of copying itself and typically has a detrimental effect, such as corrupting the system or destroying data. By plain meaning, this means that a virus is anything that harms the computer.

        Common Viruses
      </h1>

      <p class="content">
        Some of the most common types of viruses are the multipartite virus, direct action (remote control), browser hijacker, overwrite virus (usually ransomware, but sometimes intended to destroy), file infector (almost certainly ransomware), and the internet virus.

      Virus Capabilities
    </h1>

    <p class="content">
      Viruses have two main purposes: to steal and destroy. These two categories are mainly split into several smaller categories, such as Key-logging(track keyboard input), ransomware(locks up document), remote-control, theft of information, and destruction(with many ways, includes both online attacks that require an offline part on the computer, or attack on the hardware by creating files). Within these types of viruses, viruses that are meant to steal are often much harder to create and destroy than viruses with the intention to destroy.

        Trojan Viruses
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        The trojan virus is, in general, the most common type of virus. As the name suggests, trojan viruses usually appear as one program, but does something else entirely. This could include applications that sell cheaper versions of official files that are harder to obtain, free video games, etc. The easiest way in general to avoid trojan viruses is by only giving apps authentication that is directly related to what the app does, unless with good reason. This will ensure that only the “good” part of applications will be used.

        Multipartite Virus
      </h1>
  
      <p class="content">
        The Multipartite Virus is a virus that targets multiple parts of a computer at once, and is usually allowed access through unauthorized authentication. This virus is mainly spread with unauthorized/ accidentally authorized actions. This is generally agreed to be the deadliest virus, as it is self replicating, and nearly impossible to destroy. This virus’s main way of accessing the computer through the internet. The only way to stop this virus is by not authenticating anything that you do not need.
